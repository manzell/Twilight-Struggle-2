  cardText: "On the US\u2019s next action round, it must discard an Operations card
    with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat
    this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a
    die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its
    scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This
    Event cancels the effect(s) of the \u201C#106 \u2013 NORAD\u201D Event (if applicable)."
