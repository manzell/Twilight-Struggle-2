    card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat
    this Event for each USSR action round until the USSR successfully rolls 1-4 on
    a die. If the USSR is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all
    of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn."
